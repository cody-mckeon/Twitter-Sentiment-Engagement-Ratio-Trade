# Twitter-Sentiment-Engagement-Ratio-Trade
Stock Selection Based on Engagement Ratios on Twitter for each stock

This project implements a stock selection strategy based on Twitter sentiment and engagement ratios. The strategy identifies and ranks stocks by their engagement ratios (calculated as the number of Twitter comments divided by the number of Twitter likes) and constructs a portfolio of the top-performing stocks each month. The project includes backtesting the strategy against the NASDAQ-100 index to evaluate its performance.

## Project Overview

This project uses historical Twitter engagement data to rank stocks based on their relative popularity and sentiment on social media. By focusing on stocks with high engagement ratios, the strategy aims to identify companies that are generating significant interest, which might correlate with positive market performance.

### Key Features:
- **Sentiment Data Analysis**: Calculate engagement ratios for stocks based on Twitter comments and likes.
- **Portfolio Construction**: Select top stocks each month based on engagement rankings.
- **Backtesting**: Compare the strategy's performance against the NASDAQ-100 index (QQQ ETF).
